# Two different power algorithms
A very simple C++ program Calculate runtime and number of multiplication operations in two different power algorithms.

A data structure exercise that yielded interesting results for me

Including that the printing operation is very slow and sometimes operation 2^10 is done later than 2^1000.

How? Try.
